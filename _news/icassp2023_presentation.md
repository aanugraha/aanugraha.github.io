I presented our paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095717">"Exploiting Sparse Recovery Algorithms for Semi-Supervised Training of Deep Neural Networks for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation"</a> at IEEE ICASSP 2023 in Rhodes Island, Greece.
It was unfortunate that Murtiza Ali, the paper's first author, could not travel to Greece.
