I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/goalorient_tech/sound_scene_understand/">Sound Scene Understanding Team</a>, <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/index.html">Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)</a>, <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/">RIKEN</a> and a visiting researcher in the <a href="http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/">Speech and Audio Processing Group</a>, <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/">Kyoto University</a>. His current research interests include <i>audio source separation</i>, <i>audio-visual scene understanding</i>, and <i>machine learning</i>.

I received a Doctorate in Informatics from <a href="http://iaem.univ-lorraine.fr/">University of Lorraine</a>, France for the doctoral research on multichannel audio source separation based on deep neural networks done at <a href="https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/">Inria Nancy -- Grand-Est</a>, France under the supervision of <a href="https://members.loria.fr/ALiutkus/">Dr. Antoine Liutkus</a> and <a href="https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/">Dr. Emmanuel Vincent</a>. The <a href="https://www.theses.fr/en/2017LORR0212">doctoral thesis</a> covers the applications of our separation methods to speech enhancement, singing voice separation, and musical instrument separation tasks.
